This repository contains the resolution for simple C and Assembly x86 exercises ([SE1](/SE1) and [SE2](/SE2)) and a Console Application ([SE3](/SE3)) that allows listing football information retrieved from [Football-Data API](https://www.football-data.org/).

These exercises and application were developed as projects in Programação em Sistemas Computacionais (Computer Systems Programming) subject in [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt) during my degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.
